# Getting Started
Welcome to Chillax’s Organized Crime. This is a server pack, the pack is made solely for the server. This wiki page will teach you all the tricks and give you all the tips you’ll need to strive on the server. Starting off once you spawn in you will be in the Spawn Tutorial Area (S.T.A) . This area will show you the simple farms and have all the shops around. Here is where you start your journey to becoming the best criminal out there.  

# Quests
There are a handful of starter quests that will help guide you through the basics. We HIGHLY recommend that you atleast read through them, before you start playing. To access said quests open your inventory and click on the book to the left of your inventory.

# Creating Cash
The best way to start getting that sweet money is by making that  OG Kush. It's the easiest way to start and takes up a small amount of room. If that way isn’t your desired route. Then there are player shops you can start, however we recommend growing the drugs to make cash as there are multiple drugs you can grow. You may also get money by robbing the gas station, the Gas Attendant will drop a hefty amount of cash, the thugs and police may also drop some change if you want to go crazy.

# Renting a Home
Now that you understand how to make money it's time you move off the streets and get yourself a nice place to stay. There are cheap rooms in the hotel not too far away from the S.T.A. . These will be your ideal starter home, cheap and close. Once you start pulling in enough cash you can move on out of the hotel room, and find a cheap place outside the Safezone, in the PvP Zone . We warn you however the PvP Zone does have cheaper rent prices it may not be worth the extra difficulty to get around with ever looming death around every street corner. 

# Getting Resources
Eventually you will want to upgrade from no tools to something a little more spicy. There are Resource Zones scattered around the map, some are in the Safezone others are out in the PvP Zone. The zones that are deadlier tend to have better resources and more of them. We recommend bringing a weapon to keep yourself alive. Possibly bringing a team mate along may help. 

# Zones
Now in the server there are a few zones. We will list each zone and what they do so you fully understand what you're getting into.
- Safe Zone, here is where you are safe from PvP, rent prices are more expensive however.
- PvP Zone, here is where the PvP is, rent prices are lower then the safe zone.
- Nort, East, South and West Mines, these are all located in the PvP zone, so bring a weapon. You will also find better ores and more of them.
- Lumber Yards, this is where you get your wood from, they are in both the PvP and the Safe zones.
- Nether and End Mines, these are located in the PvP zone, this is where you will find your quartz and enderpearls and such.
- The Mansion, this is where the Drug Seller is located, he will buy all your drugs and also sell you seeds.

# Getting Settled
Now that you’ve started bringing in some cash and got a handful of ressources it’s time you start becoming more efficient. There are many machines that will improve your quality of life and make things more obtainable. These are some of the mods we recommend using to get started.
